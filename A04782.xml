            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="121" facs="tcp:8436:87"/>For as in the creation of the vvorld it vvas no miracle that God imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatlie by himſelfe alone should creat the firſt creatures, (nature then requiring it) but aftervvard the courſe of nature required that he should vſe the ſecond cauſes to vvorke, and ſo to let a man generate a man, and a lion a lion, and fier fier, and therefore now vvould be a miracle and aboue the courſe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture if God should create a man, beaſt, or plante immediatlie: So it vvas no extraordinarie thing but neceſſarie that at firſt Chriſt should elect and conſtitute his vicegerent Peeter, though novv if Chriſt should elect his Vicair im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatlie, and not by the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, it would bee extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and as it were miraculous, though now alſo Chriſt immedia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlie giueth Peeters ſucceſſour his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:8436:88"/>as is aboue declared: euen as now although God vſeth man as a ſecond cauſe to generate man, and to diſpoſe to the creation of mans ſoule, yet God onelie crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth and infuſeth the ſoule. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Peeters authoritie in reſpect of its extente was ordinarie, he being conſtituted ordinarie Paſtour of the vniuerſall Church, as aboue is prooued. And hence it is that the Bishop of Rome is paſtour ouer the whole Church, becauſe he ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to Peeter, as Ordinarie Paſtour of the ſayed Church. But becauſe the vniuerſall Iuriſdiction of the Apoſtles was extraordinarie and delegate, therefore Bishops (who are their ſucceſſours) do not ſucceed them in that ample Iuriſdiction.
<note place="margin">If anie of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles liued after Pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he was ſubiect to Peeters ſucceſſour</note> Out of which it followeth that if after Peeters death anie of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles should be liuing, they should
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:8436:88"/>be ſubordinate to Peeters ſucceſſour euen as they were to Peeter, onelie they should exceed Peeters ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour in this, that they could make Canonicall Scripture, whereas the Bishop of Rome can onely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue it, and define which is ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which is not, and what is the trew meaning of it, and what is not.</p>

               <p n="1">1. I Haue shewed in the tenth Chapter that the Church can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſubſiſte without Bishops, for that the Church is a Monarchie and Hierarchie in which there is not onlie one Chiefe Bishop Peeters Succeſſour and Chriſte his Vicar, who is one ſupreme paſtour of the whole Church, but alſo diuers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Bishops, heades of particular Churches. And this diuerſitie of Bishops is by Chriſtes diuine lawe and ordinance eſtablished in the Church. Hence it is that when anie ſuch number as required a Bishop
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:8436:216"/>was conuerted, by and by euen in the Apoſtles tymes, a Bishop vvas appointed ouer them, as S.

<note place="margin">VVhen any coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie was conuerted by and by a Bishop there wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s ordained.</note> as the number of Chriſtians required. Hence it is that vvhen anie countrie vvas con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted by anie one vvho vvas not Bishop, the firſt thing was to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate there a Bishop. So ſaint Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin the Monke although he vvas not Bishop vvhen he firſt preached in England, yet when there was a number of Chriſtians conuerted ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of a Bishop, not onlie he but diuers others as Iuſtus and Meli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, were ordained Bishops. So ſaint
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:8436:217"/>Boniface when he firſt preached to the Germanes was not Bishop, yet after, vvhen the number of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians increaſed, he and others vvere appointed Bishops.

               <p n="2">2. <note place="margin">An obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</note> But ſome maie alleage, that although Bishops are neceſſarie in the vvhole Church, yet they are not ſo neceſſarie for euerie parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church, but that a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church may be Gouerned, at leaſt, for a tyme vvithout a Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hop, that is till the tyme of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution be blovvn ouer and the ſtorme appeaſed.

And I argue thus: by the diuine lavve there muſt be particular Bishops in the Church, as in the former Chapter I haue prooued that there muſt be; But there is no more reaſon vvhy the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Church of France (for I ſpeake eſpeciallie of greate particular Churches, which are notable partes of the whole Church) should be gouerned by a Bishop or Bishops moe or fevver according to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the Countrie, rather the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Church of Spayne, or the Church

Which maketh mee demaund why the Popes and Bishops in the primitiue Church were ſo diligent and exact in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crating Bishops; yea and making Popes euen in the middeſt of the greateſt perſecutions, and when the perſecutions vvere principallie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended againſt Popes and Bishops; and vvould not for feare of perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or other humane reſpects let a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie countrie or Church eſpeciallie of anie greatnes to be vvithout a

               <p n="4">4. For as, all though euerie one is not bound vnder mortall ſinne to receiue a Prieſt, or to keepe him in his howſe, if he ſee probablie, that thereby he shall hazard his life libertie or landes; yet Catholiques cannot except againſt the miſsion of Prieſts into their cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trie, becauſe vvithout Prieſts the people can haue no Sacraments, nor abſolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from ſinnes, no ſacrifice, no prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the word of God; which
